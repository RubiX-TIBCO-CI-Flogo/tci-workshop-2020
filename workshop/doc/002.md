# 3. Build and Deploy Your API #

In this section you'll push an app implemented in BusinessWorks from Business Studio to TIBCO Cloud. Functionally, the app implements a system API that gets purchase orders from SAP Hana.

After that you'll create a Flogo app that implements a process API that creates sales orders, by first invoking the system API that gets a purchase order from SAP Hana, then invoking a system API that gets contact details from Salesforce, and finally creates a sales order by invoking a system API for SAP ERP.

## 3.1 BusinessWorks Apps in TIBCO Cloud Integration ##

In this lab, you'll first connect TIBCO Business Studio™ for BusinessWorks from your workstation to TIBCO Cloud. You'll then import a BusinessWorks project into Business Studio that implements a system API that gets purchase orders from SAP Hana. Finally, you'll push the BusinessWorks app to TIBCO Cloud and test it.

### 3.1.1 Getting Ready ###

To get ready, open TIBCO Business Studio™ for BusinessWorks. Assuming you start with a clean enviroment, your screen should look similar to this:

3. Once the **SAPHanaAPI** app is running, hover over the **Endpoint** link, and select **View and Test** from the menu

4. Test the **SAPHanaAPI** app by filling out a value in the **orderId** field, and clicking on the **Try it out!** button:

    ![View and Test](images/bw_view_test.jpg)

5. Copy the URL, which has a pattern like `https://integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/xxxxx/PurchaseOrders/purchaseOrders/{orderId}`, and store it somewhere. You will need it when you implement the process API in the next lab.

## 3.2 Flogo Apps in TIBCO Cloud Integration ##

In this lab you'll implement a process API that creates sales orders, by first invoking the system API that gets a purchase order from SAP Hana, then invoking a system API that gets contact details from Salesforce, and finally creates a sales order by invoking a system API for SAP ERP.

You will first create a "skeleton" Flogo app from the **SalesOrders** API specification. Then you will implement the flow with the 3 system API calls, to finally push the Flogo app and test it.

### 3.2.1 Getting Ready ###

To be able to create the "skeleton" Flogo app from the **SalesOrders** API specification, do the following:

1. Navigate to the API specifications by clicking on the **API Specs** menu item.
2. Select the group you've created the **SalesOrders** API specification in, e.g. **MyTCIWorkshop**.
3. Your screen should look similar to:

    ![SaleOrder API Spec](images/sales_order_api_spec_flogo.jpg)

### 3.2.2 How to Do It: Create the Skeleton Flogo App from the API Specification ###

To create a "skeleton" Flogo app from on the **SalesOrders** API specification, do the following:

1. Hover over the **SalesOrders** record to the right of the preview icon, and select **Create Flogo app** from the menu:

    ![Create Flogo App](images/create_flogo_app.jpg)
2. Create a Flogo app by clicking on the **Create** button in next form:

    ![Create Flogo App](images/create_flogo_app_001.jpg)

### 3.2.3 How to Do It: Implement the Flogo App ###

In this lab, you'll create a process API that creates sales orders by making 3 system API calls. The address of first system API call is the URL of the BusinessWorks app you have pushed and tested in the previous lab. The adresses of the other API calls are from apps we have already deployed, and their URLs are specified below.

To implement the process API, do the following:

1. Navigate from the app **salesorders_1_0_flogo_app** to the skeleton flow **postSync_orderId_POST**.

2. To enable data to flow between the trigger and the flow, you first need to map the trigger output to the flow input, and flow data to the trigger reply. Click on the ![Flogo Trigger](images/flogo_trigger.jpg) icon to open the configuration of the **ReceiveHTTPMessage** trigger.

3. Map the trigger output to the flow input as follows:

    ![Trigger Ouput](images/trigger_output.jpg)

4. Map the flow data to the trigger reply as follows:

    ![Trigger Reply](images/trigger_reply.jpg)

5. Close the trigger configuration screen, and move the **Return** tile at least 3 positions to the right. Create a first activity, by clicking on the left-most `+` and navigate through **General > Invoke REST Service**. Configure this activity as follows:

    1. Give it a name: **GetPurchaseOrder**.
    2. In the **Settings** section, specify the following fields:

        | Field         | Value           |

        | URL | `https://integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/xxxxx/PurchaseOrders/purchaseOrders/{orderId}` |
        | Use certificate for verification | `false` |

       **Note**: Do not copy-and-paste the URL from the above table. Use the URL you copied in the previous lab, when you tested the purchase order API.

    3. In the **Input** section, create the following mapping:

        | Activity Input | Upstream Output |
        | -------------  | --------------- |
        | `pathParams.orderId` | `$flow.pathParams.orderId` |

    4. In the **Output Settings** section, ensure the **Response Type** is set to `application/json`, and copy the following json structure into the **Response Schema**:

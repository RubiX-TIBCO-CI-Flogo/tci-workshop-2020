# 3. Build and Deploy Your API #

In this section we will demo how to push an app implemented in BusinessWorks from Business Studio to TIBCO Cloud. Functionally, the app implements a system API that gets purchase orders from SAP Hana.

After that you'll create a Flogo app that implements a process API that creates sales orders, by first invoking the system API that gets a purchase order from SAP Hana, then invoking a system API that gets contact details from Salesforce, and finally creates a sales order by invoking a system API for SAP ERP.

    ![Project Explorer](images/bw_project_explorer_end.jpg)

### 3.1.4 How to Do It: Push the Project to TIBCO Cloud and Test It ###

To push the SAP Hana system API app to TIBCO Cloud, do the following:

1. In the Project Explorer, select **SAPHanaAPI > Push to Cloud ...**:

    ![Push to Cloud](images/bw_push_to_cloud.jpg)

2. Navigate to TIBCO Cloud, and once the app has been successfully pushed, your screen should look like this:

    ![Push to Cloud](images/bw_push_to_cloud_end.jpg)


    *Alternative for when you don't have TIBCO Business Studio installed on your system*
    You can import my [`SAPHanaAPI_1.0.0.ear`](../src/bw_projects/SAPHanaAPI_1.0.0.ear) and [`manifest.json`](../src/bw_projects/manifest.json) file from the [`src/bw_projects`](../src/bw_projects) directory. 
    
    In the https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/applications screen choose import and select BusinessWorks
    <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/import_bw.jpg" width=40% height=40%>
    
    In the next screen click upload and select both the ear and json files.
    
    <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/import_files.jpg" width=30% height=30%>
    
    Then press the import button.

3. Once the **SAPHanaAPI** app is running, hover over the **Endpoint** link, and select **View and Test** from the menu

4. Test the **SAPHanaAPI** app by filling out a value in the **orderId** field, and clicking on the **Try it out!** button:

    ![View and Test](images/bw_view_test.jpg)

5. Copy the URL, which has a pattern like `https://integration.cloud.tibcoapps.com:443/xxxxx/PurchaseOrders/purchaseOrders/{orderId}`, and store it somewhere. You will need it when you implement the process API in the next lab.

## 3.2 Flogo Apps in TIBCO Cloud Integration ##

In this lab you'll implement a process API that creates sales orders, by first invoking the system API that gets a purchase order from SAP Hana, then invoking a system API that gets contact details from Salesforce, and finally creates a sales order by invoking a system API for SAP ERP.

You will first create a "skeleton" Flogo app from the **SalesOrders** API specification. Then you will implement the flow with the 3 system API calls, to finally push the Flogo app and test it.

### 3.2.1 Getting Ready ###

To be able to create the "skeleton" Flogo app from the **SalesOrders** API specification, do the following:

1. Navigate to the API specifications by clicking on the **API Specs** menu item.
2. Select the group you've created the **SalesOrders** API specification in, e.g. **MyTCIWorkshop**.
3. Your screen should look similar to:

    ![SaleOrder API Spec](images/sales_order_api_spec_flogo.jpg)

### 3.2.2 How to Do It: Create the Skeleton Flogo App ###

To create a "skeleton" Flogo app from on the **SalesOrders** API specification, do the following:

1. Navigate to the API specifications by clicking on the **Apps** menu item (or follow https://integration.cloud.tibco.com/applications).
        
2. Create a Flogo app by clicking on the **Create** button, select **Flogo** and click the **Create New App** button
 
    <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/create_flogo_app.jpg" width=45% height=45%>
 
3. You can rename your created flogo app to **sales_orders_1_0_flogo_app**

    <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/create_flogo_app_001.jpg" width=60% height=60%>
    
 
### 3.2.3 How to Do It: Implement the Flogo App ###

In this lab, you'll create a process API that creates sales orders by making 3 system API calls. The address of first system API call is the URL of the BusinessWorks app you have pushed and tested in the previous lab. The adresses of the other API calls are from apps we have already deployed, and their URLs are specified below.

To implement the process API, do the following:

1. Create a new skeleton flow by clicking Create.
   
   <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/create_flogo_flow.jpg" width=30% height=30%>

2. Fill in the name **postSync_orderId_POST** and click Create.

   <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/create_flogo_flow_002.jpg" width=50% height=50%>

3. Click on the plus button on the left of the screen to add a new trigger.

   <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/add_flogo_trigger.jpg" width=50% height=50%>

4. Search for the **Receive HTTP Message** trigger and click it to continue

   <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/add_flogo_trigger_002.jpg" width=50% height=50%>
  
5. Configure your trigger as in the screenshot below. Use **/sync/{orderId}** in Resource Path. Click Continue. In the next screen choose option "Just add the trigger".

   <img src="https://github.com/RubiX-TIBCO-CI-Flogo/tci-workshop-2020/blob/master/workshop/doc/images/add_flogo_trigger_003.jpg" width=50% height=50%>

6. To enable data to flow between the trigger and the flow, you first need to map the trigger output to the flow input, and flow data to the trigger reply. Click on the ![Flogo Trigger](images/flogo_trigger.jpg) icon to open the configuration of the **ReceiveHTTPMessage** trigger.

7. Map the trigger output to the flow input as follows:

    ![Trigger Ouput](images/trigger_output.jpg)

8. Map the flow data to the trigger reply as follows:

    ![Trigger Reply](images/trigger_reply.jpg)

9. Close the trigger configuration screen, and move the **Return** tile at least 3 positions to the right. Create a first activity, by clicking on the left-most `+` and navigate through **General > Invoke REST Service**. Configure this activity as follows:

    1. Give it a name: **GetPurchaseOrder**.
    2. In the **Settings** section, specify the following fields:

        | Use certificate for verification | `false` |

       **Note**: Do not copy-and-paste the URL from the above table. Use the URL you copied in the previous lab, when you tested the purchase order API.

    3. In the **Input** section, create the following mapping:

        | Activity Input | Upstream Output |
        | -------------  | --------------- |
        | `pathParams.orderId` | `$flow.pathParams.orderId` |

    4. In the **Output Settings** section, ensure the **Response Type** is set to `application/json`, and copy the following json structure into the **Response Schema**:
